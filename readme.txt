A pretty straight-forward banking account console. 
6 choices in the banking menu: create a new account, deposit x, withdraw x, get account balance, get transactions history or quit the menu.
Connected the console to MySQL Database. Creates a new table entry in accounts and transactions table. Updates the balance each time a change is made. 
Transactions history shows timestamp, type of transaction etc.
Each new account is given a account ID as per the table entry.
